        <p>I know, I know. It doesn’t look like much. Yet</p>

    <p>But on my own code learning journey this webpage represents a bit of technical milestone for me as I put the whole thing together with a command line and a keyboard, no windows, no menus, no mouse :-)</p>

    <p>I installed Ubuntu LTS 16.04 then complied Node and Express from source, and that’s what I'm using to serve this page to you now</p>
    <p>The page itself will be evolving quickly as I progress through <a href="https://bloc.io" target="_blank">Bloc’s</a> Full Stack Web Dev curriculum, and will eventually turn into my personal blog and a portfolio of my completed projects and freelance work.  But for the time being you may see some odd features that make no sense for a page like this, but that's just me playing with new tools and concepts while I hone my skills</p>

    <p>I thought this article was helpful to me as a Windows user to help ease me back in to the Linux/CLI I learned many years ago: <a href="https://char.gd/blog/2017/how-to-set-up-the-perfect-modern-dev-environment-on-windows" target="_blank">How to set up the perfect modern dev environment on Windows</a></p>
    <p>This was also very helpful in helping me get my HTTP server running, though it is a bit out of date when it comes to using Upstart instead of systemd to run it as a service: <a href="http://seanvbaker.com/setting-up-a-node-website" target="_blank">The Node Den - Setting Up a Node.js Website</a></p>
