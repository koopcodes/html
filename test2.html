**_Questions_**
> Why is accessibility so important?

A: So ALL Users, regardless of ability or disability, will be able to access my site and the information it contains and have as good a User Experience as possible.  Also it will help SEO efforts as well as make it easier for various forms of screen readers

> What are some forms of accessibility as it relates to web development?

A: Forms of Accessibility
  * Visual - when designing content consider people with blindness, poor vision, color blindness, and don't forget photo epileptic seizures caused by visual strobe or flashing effects! 
  * Motor - make my site accessible and EASILY NAVIGABLE to those with lost or impaired hand control.  I HATE nested drop downs!!!!!!
  * Auditory - Not everyone can hear. Don't autoplay audio or video!
  * Cognitive - Things like ADD, Dyslexia, and Autism or even just having a concussion will make a difference in how people want or need to access our information.  Things needs to be very clearly associated and presented

> In your own words, what does semantic mean?

A: In my own words?  Hmmm....Semantic would relate to the **_meaning_** of words or combinations of words in a language   

> What is semantic HTML?

A: Semantic HTML goes beyond just presentation or the look of page content, and tries to indicate and reinforce the **_meaning_** of the the information in a web page or app through the use of elements more descriptive that just `<div>` or `<span>`

> What are some common accessibility issues your end users might have? a. What are some steps you would take to make their experience on your site better?

A: Sort of ironic since we are talking accessibility and the first item in my markdown table below says use high contrast BG and Text, but I **cannot** seem to get the table to display as normal text color, nor can I get the cell borders to appear. Let me know if you have problems reading it and I will submit it again and try to not be so cute with the markdown
