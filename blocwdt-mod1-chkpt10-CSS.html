> What is the difference between inline, internal, and external styling? Which will you most commonly use?

A: **Inline Styling** is when CSS is placed inside a tag, **Internal Styling** has the CSS inside the page's `<head>` element, and **External Styling** means the CSS is in a different file linked to the page using a `<link>` tag

> Why are id selectors inhibiting?

A: Because an ID must be unique and can only be used once per page

> Is the `<div>` with class `altfoo` an immediate child of the `<div>` with `foo`? Why or why not?

A: This was a good question, because it really stretched my understanding of what an immediate child was. I was going to say yes, then I was going to say no, then I did write a yes answer ("Yes, `<div class="altfoo">` is an immediate child of `<div id="foo">` because no other element surrounds `<div class="altfoo">` except `<div id="foo">`" was my previous answer), but then in trying to answer the next question I put it into CodePen here [https://codepen.io/koopdev/pen/rdNZer] and surprise surprise `.foo>p{background:green}` doesn't turn that last `<p>` inside `<div class = "altfoo">` green so `<div class = "altfoo">` is not an immediate child of `<div id = "foo">`
    
> Which element(s) will the following selector select? `.foo p {}`

A: That will select all `<p>` elements since they are all descendants of `<div id = "foo">`

> Which element(s) will the following selector select? `.foo > p{}`

A: That will select only the first two `<p>` elements, but not the third inside `<div class = "altfoo">` because it is not an immediate child of `<div id = "foo">`

> What psuedo-selector would you write to select the first `<p>` element?

A: `p:first-child {}`
